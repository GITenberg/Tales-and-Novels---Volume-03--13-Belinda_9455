description: "Belinda is an 1801 novel by the Irish writer Maria Edgeworth. It was\
  \ first published in three volumes by Joseph Johnson of London, and was reprinted\
  \ by Pandora Press in 1986. The novel was Edgeworth's second published, and was\
  \ considered controversial in its day for its depiction of an interracial marriage.\n\
  In its first (1801) and second (1802) editions, Juba, an African servant on a plantation\
  \ in Jamaica, marries an English farm-girl named Lucy. But the third edition of\
  \ the book, published in 1810, omits the character Juba, and instead has Lucy betrothed\
  \ to one James Jackson. Also, in the first two editions, Belinda almost marries\
  \ Mr. Vincent, a rich West Indian Creole; in the 1810 edition, Belinda only esteems\
  \ him and never agrees to marry him. It has been argued that this change came at\
  \ the insistence of Edgeworth's father, rather than the author herself, because\
  \ he edited several of her works.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
